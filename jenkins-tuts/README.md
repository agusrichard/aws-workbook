### Jenkins Infrasturcture
- Master server:
  - Control pipelines
  - Schedule builds
- Agents/minions:
  - Perform the build


### Agent Types
- Pernament agent:
  - Dedicated servers for running jobs
  - Standalone server like Linux and Windows
- Cloud agent
  - Ephemeral/dynamic agents spun up on demand

### Build Types
- Freestyle build: Pretty much like scripting
- Pipelines: Composed by stages or steps

I'm curious on why it's not working. It supposed to be working, but it's not working!
