AWS things to practise:
[Section 6: EC2 Instance Storage]
x Create an ec2 instance
x Check for the root volume (EBS volume)
x Create an EBS volume and attach it to ec2 instance
x Need to be in the same az

x Create ebs snapshot
x Copy it to different az

x Create AMI
x Launch using the previous AMI

x Create AMI using ec2 image builder
x Connect to ec2 instance from above process

[Section 7: ELB and ASG]
- create 3 ec3 instances
- create elb
- create target groups

- make launch template
- create lb
- create asg


[Section S3]
- create s3 bucket
- upload an object (image)
- create folder
- upload an object into this folder

- change s3 bucket policies to public
- make sure that the uploaded objects can be accessed publicly

- host static website
- test the generated static website

- Upload the same file (and have versioning)
- Delete the last file
- Delete one file (introduce delete marker)
- Rollback so we have back the deleted file
